Each can is tuned to allow (bandpass) or block (notch) specific frequencies. The transmit frequency needs to be blocked from the receiver and the receive frequencey needs to be blocked from the transmitter. Here's the WM9W duplexer. The small tubes and a knob at the top of each are used to make adjustments. More than you probably want to know is available in John E.
