The duplexer allows both the transmitter and receiver to use the same antenna si]multanously,

The WM9W duplexer consists of four turned circuits, called cavaities, or just "cans".

Each can is tuned to allow (bandpass) or block (notch) specific frequencies. The transmit frequency needs to be blocked from the receiver and the receive frequencey needs to be blocked from the transmitter.

Here's the WM9W duplexer. The small tubes and a knob at the top of each are used to make adjustments.
